# Code of Conduct

This project is governed by explicit rules, not informal norms.

Participation in ATLAS—through discussion, issues, reviews, or contributions—
is subject to the same principles that govern the system itself:
clarity, traceability, and respect for defined boundaries.

This code of conduct exists to protect constructive reasoning,
not to enforce politeness for its own sake.



## Expected Conduct

All participants are expected to:

- Communicate in a precise, respectful, and non-adversarial manner.
- Base arguments on explicit references to the project artifacts
  (e.g. project_constitution, PIPELINE_IDENTITY, governance rules).
- Accept rejection without escalation when decisions are grounded in governance.
- Keep discussions focused on structure, constraints, and intent—not personal preference.
- Respect the separation between opinion, evidence, and authority.

Disagreement is acceptable.
Unstructured debate is not.



## Unacceptable Conduct

The following behaviors are not permitted:

- Attempting to bypass or weaken governance constraints through argumentation.
- Reframing rejected decisions as personal disagreements.
- Introducing assumptions not grounded in project artifacts.
- Repeatedly reopening closed topics without new, traceable information.
- Shifting discussions toward speed, convenience, or “practical shortcuts”
  at the expense of system integrity.
- Any form of personal attack, pressure, or dismissive language.

Technical correctness does not excuse governance violations.



## Governance Supremacy

All behavioral decisions are subordinate to the project’s governing documents:

- `project_constitution.md`
- `governance_principles.md`
- `governance_gate.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

If documents conflict, the Project Constitution takes precedence.

When a conflict arises, governance takes precedence over consensus.

Moderation decisions are not subject to negotiation
if they are traceable to these documents.



## Enforcement

Violations of this code of conduct may result in:

- Redirection of discussion,
- Closure of issues or pull requests,
- Restriction of participation.

Enforcement actions are taken to preserve system integrity,
not to arbitrate personal disputes.



## Final Statement

ATLAS values disciplined thinking over unrestricted expression.

Participation here implies agreement to operate within defined boundaries.
If these constraints feel limiting, this project may not be a suitable environment.
